Specific Details:


Source Port: 12345 (your WPA3 server)
Destination Port: 60414 (your client)
Sequence Number: 33
Acknowledgment Number: 39
Window Size: 2161152
Direction: Server to Client


Given the payload size (96 bytes) and the direction, this is likely one of the encrypted messages during the post-handshake communication phase. Based on your code, it's probably one of these messages:

pythonCopymessage = f"AP Test Message #{i+1}: The connection is secure!"
The larger size (96 bytes) indicates this is encrypted data because:

It includes the IV (16 bytes)
The actual message is padded (PKCS7 padding)
The message is encrypted using AES-CBC mode
